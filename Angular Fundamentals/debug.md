# Debugging

## Developer tool debugging

sources ->main.bundle.js-> look for the line

source maps are little addition to cli adds to our bundles, which allows our browser to translate javascript code to typescript files.(in development only)

To access typescript files directly
webpack -> . folder -> src -> the files
