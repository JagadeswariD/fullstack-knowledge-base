# Core Types and Structures:

## Primitive types : number, string, and boolean

let age : number; // variable declaration
age=12;
or
let age : number =12; // declaration and assignment
let username : string ='Max';
let isAccepted : boolean = true;

Types begin with lowercase, like 'number' and 'string' not as 'Number' and 'String'. The Number refers to Number object in JavaScript, not the type 'number'.
