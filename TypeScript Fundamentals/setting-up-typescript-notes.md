## Setting up TypeScript:

To install within a project
npm install typescript

To install globally in ur system
npm install -g typescript

command to run the compiler via tsc
npx tsc

To create empty package.json file to add the dependencies
npm init -y ===>

TypeScript code will not work in the browser as such, if u try to execute the typescript code in the browser, it will fail. So we need to compile the typescript to JavaScript for the browser to execute the commands.
