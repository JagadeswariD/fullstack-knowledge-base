# TypeScript

TypeScript is superset of JavaScript, it is a programming language build on top of JavaScript. It extends JavaScript. Adds static typing to JavaScript. JavaScript is dynamic type.

JavaScript provides language primitives like string and number, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently assigned these. TypeScript does.

The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.

TypeScript can build a type-system that accepts JavaScript code but has types.
let helloWorld = "Hello World";

let helloWorld: string
